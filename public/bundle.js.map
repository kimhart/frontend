Does not clone if nothing changed.\n * - `visit(child, state)`: Processes the child node, calling the appropriate\n *   `visit{Field,Fragment,Root` method based on the node type.\n *\n * All of these methods may return the original node in order to leave it\n * intact.\n *\n * @see RelayQueryVisitor\n */\n\nvar RelayQueryTransform = function (_RelayQueryVisitor) {\n  (0, _inherits3['default'])(RelayQueryTransform, _RelayQueryVisitor);\n\n  function RelayQueryTransform() {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3['default'])(this, RelayQueryTransform);\n    return (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3['default'])(this, _RelayQueryVisitor.apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  RelayQueryTransform.prototype.traverse = function traverse(node, nextState) {\n    if (!node.canHaveSubselections()) {\n      return node;\n    }\n    var nextChildren = void 0;\n    this.traverseChildren(node, nextState, function (child, index, children) {\n      var prevChild = children[index];\n      var nextChild = this.visit(prevChild, nextState);\n      if (nextChild !== prevChild) {\n        nextChildren = nextChildren || children.slice(0, index);\n      }\n      if (nextChildren && nextChild) {\n        nextChildren.push(nextChild);\n      }\n    }, this);\n    if (nextChildren) {\n      if (!nextChildren.length) {\n        return null;\n      }\n      return node.clone(nextChildren);\n    }\n    return node;\n  };\n\n  return RelayQueryTransform;\n}(require('./RelayQueryVisitor'));\n\nmodule.exports = RelayQueryTransform;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/react-relay/lib/RelayQueryTransform.js\n// module id = 400\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
